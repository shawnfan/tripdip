== TripDip

Demo project. Built on RubyOnRails + AngularJS + Angular Material Design

Please feel free to checkout the site [TripDip](tripdip.heroku.com) for demo.

This simple one-page web application utilizes `AngularJS` and `Material design`. It's main purpose is to practice Angular Material such as using the `layout attributes, input methods, image-white-frame` ... etc. Also, I have finally started coding css with `SCSS`, which appears to be quite programmer-friendly just because I can wrap things nicely in `{}`.

There is no backend for this web, and it's not mobile-responsive, not yet. I probably won't go further into this project besides practicing Angular Material and SCSS.
